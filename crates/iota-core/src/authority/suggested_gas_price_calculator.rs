/// 3. For every deferred/cancelled transaction, obtain its estimated execution
///    duration, as well as all input shared objects.
/// 4. Calculate a suggested gas price for the deferred/cancelled transaction as
///    follows:
///    - compute its (imaginary) execution start time as congestion limit per
///      commit minus its estimated execution duration;
///    - for each input shared object, get the maximum gas price over scheduled
///      transactions whose end execution time is larger than our imaginary

///    - take the maximum over the values obtained in the previous step;
///    - the suggested gas price equals the maximum value obtained in the
