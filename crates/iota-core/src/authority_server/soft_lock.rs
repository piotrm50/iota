//! Pre-consensus soft locking for the P-COOL transaction flow.
//!
//! This module provides an in-memory, defense-in-depth mechanism that prevents
//! a validator from accepting two transactions that conflict on the same owned
//! objects at pre-submission time, and from forwarding duplicate resubmissions
//! of a transaction that is already in flight (its locks are still held). The
//! authoritative conflict resolution remains in post-consensus validation
//! (`post_consensus_validation.rs`); this layer merely reduces wasted
//! consensus bandwidth and client-visible latency.
//!
//! Every user transaction holds at least one owned object (its gas coin), so
//! the lock table sees every transaction and duplicate suppression covers
//! shared-object transactions too.
//!
//! # Edge cases
//!
//! | Case                            | Behavior                                                              |
//! |---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | Same tx digest, locks held      | Rejected with `RecentlyResubmitted` until released or expired         |
//! | Same tx digest, locks released/expired | Re-acquired; passes through                                    |
//! | Different tx, same owned objects | Soft lock conflict → `ObjectLockConflict` error                       |
//! | Tx processed by consensus        | Released in `authority_per_epoch_store` after quarantine               |
//! | Tx dropped in post-consensus     | Released in `authority_per_epoch_store` after quarantine               |
//! | Tx forgotten by consensus        | TTL expiry releases locks via background sweep                        |
//! | Consensus submission fails       | Locks released immediately in error path                              |
//! | Crash / restart                  | All soft locks lost → clean slate; post-consensus is authoritative    |
//! | Epoch boundary                   | Same instance is `clear()`-ed; all locks dropped                      |
//! | Object version mismatch          | Keyed on full `ObjectRef`; different versions don't conflict          |
//!
//! # TTL derivation
//!
//! Default TTL = `gc_depth(60) × 4 / ~20 rounds/sec = 12 s`.
//! Must be ≥ 2× the consensus GC window (`gc_depth / round_rate ≈ 3 s`) so that
//! a transaction has time to be committed or garbage-collected before the soft
//! lock expires.  4× provides a safety margin for network jitter.
